# CS482-similarity-search-app
Streamlit python app for similarity between face images:

NOTE: Uploading images on the similarity search app (currently) does nothing. Additionally, the similarity search app does not display any images due to the dataset images not being able to be uploaded onto GitHub. However, it still functions as it should to find the 10 closest images and will instead display their filenames. In order to view the actual images, you can download the .ipynb file accordingly.
